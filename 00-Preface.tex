3 problems
\begin{itemize}
\item{Non-technical people creating apps}
\item{Rapid prototyping to validate an idea}
\item{All-in-one solution for collaborative apps}
\end{itemize}
Solution: \\ \\
Collaborative modeling framework.
M2M transformation
\\ \\
Results: \\ \\
How long does it take? \\
How easy? \\
Variety of collaborative applications? i.e. how many different collaborative apps can we create with the modeling framework? How extensive is the framework? (collaborative patterns)
\\ \\
Interpretation: \\ \\
- Is it easier and faster? \\
- How domain specific are our modeled applications?
