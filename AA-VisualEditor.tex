\chapter{Visual Editor}
 
The collaborative modeling framework allows a developer to model a working Android application that has significant complexity, with a minimal knowledge of the Android SDK. However, the specification of the framework and the meta-models itself are quite verbose. In this appendix, an alternative approach to modeling an Android application is shown, by using a visual editor. This editor restricts the modeler to a certain domain, but allows him/her to easily model an application within a few minutes. In the next sections, we will show how the editor was created and how we use EGL and ETL to create the right target models that conform to the meta-models of the original collaborative modeling framework.
